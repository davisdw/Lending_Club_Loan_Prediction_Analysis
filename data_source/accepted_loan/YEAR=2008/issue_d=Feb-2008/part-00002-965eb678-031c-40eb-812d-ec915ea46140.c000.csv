8000.0,15.45,,< 1 year,RENT,29000.0,Does not meet the credit policy. Status:Fully Paid,I'll never be here again!) After coming back to the States,I opened up Card #2 and transferred the balance--but eventually charged Card #1 right back up.  So here I am,only able to afford minimum monthly payments. I no longer use either card (they are in an envelope in a filing cabinet at home) as I've FINALLY realized the evil of using the credit card. I'm at my first job out of college making less than $30,but I'm never seeing the principal balances go down.   I also have a fairly large student loan to pay off,but those payments are actually much more manageable--I just feel like Card #1 and #2 have been a total drain on my bank account for the last few years. Being able to pay them both off with an $8000 loan would allow me to have a much simpler debt to control with a foreseeable END
