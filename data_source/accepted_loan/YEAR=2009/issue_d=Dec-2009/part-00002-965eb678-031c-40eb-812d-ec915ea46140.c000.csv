A mistake was made in my profile regarding my work history. I have been employed at my present company for 18+ years and previously at DuPont for 17 years. As I stated I am only trying to get rid of two high interest accounts and move foward towards saving for retirement. I have a decent small nest egg but using it to pay off these two obligations could put me in a position I would not like to be in with this economy. It makes sense to combine these into a single payment with a much smaller rate and be done with it in three years and move on. My credit history should prove that I always pay my bills and am never late. I have the standard bills: mortgage,debt_consolidation,Good-bye High Interest,22.52,0.0

We have recently moved out of state due to a job change and unexpected costs have caused us to charge more frequently on our credit cards.  We have good credit and have always paid our bills on time but now we are just paying minimum payments.  Life and the economy is stressfull enough these days but to not have credit card debt and medical debt would be a BIG stress reliever.  Please consider us for funding!<br/> 574834 added on 11/28/09 > If we could pay off all our credit cards and medical bills,etc.  We will cancel all credit cards to ensure that we do not charge for unnecessary reasons,especially the smaller cards like BELK,if we we don't have the money for materialist items,then we don't need it and we will wait until the next payday
