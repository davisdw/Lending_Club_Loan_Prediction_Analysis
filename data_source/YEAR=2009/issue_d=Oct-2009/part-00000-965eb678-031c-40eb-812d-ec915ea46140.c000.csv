I sincerely appreciate this opportunity. For those unfamiliar with my goals and mindset,please read on.****  I am dedicated to consolidating my high interest debt. Positive credit and payment history should be rewarded with reasonable terms...  I have outstanding credit and a payment history of no delinquencies or late payments in my 20 year credit history,and not with more going to interest than principal. The best way to achieve this is to pay it off completely by consolidating the debt into a loan with more fair interest rate terms which will allow me to pay it far more quickly.  I am asking for funds to accomplish this as both I and my wife have a clear goal in mind - purchase a home in the future and finally start a family. Due to my wife's recent pregnancy loss eariler this year,we feel that destiny rewarded our angel baby back up to heaven to give us more time to refocus and better plan ahead for our future and that of our family. As such before we try again
