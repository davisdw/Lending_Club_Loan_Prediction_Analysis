We are at LC because a bank has either turned us down for a loan or the interest rates were higher than the debt we have. We realize that we rather see a peer profit from our loans as well as helping us succeed.<br/><br/>Will this loan be paid back in 36 months. I have EVERY intention to pay this loan in LESS than 36 months. I would like to purchase a house in the future,these expenses were incurred from surgery that my daughter had. The first surgery was covered under health insurance. The second surgery was required around the time we lost our insurance plan and state assistance was denied. Anyone that has had surgery has seen what the costs could be. My parents have helped me pay off some of this expense. If you are curious about how much,I would have to answer at least $6,but finances are what keeps us in check. <br/><br/>If you have any questions,"please let me know.
