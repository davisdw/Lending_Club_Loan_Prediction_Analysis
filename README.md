# Weighted Average Analysis
Based on the feature importances obtained from the predictive model, we can observe the following key findings:

Interest Rate (int_rate): It is the most significant predictor of loan default, with a feature importance score of approximately 0.027. This suggests that higher interest rates are associated with a higher likelihood of default.

Installment: The installment amount has a moderate impact on loan default, with a feature importance score of around 0.017. Higher installment amounts may contribute to increased default risk.

Delinquencies in the Past 2 Years (delinq_2yrs): Delinquency history, as indicated by the number of delinquencies in the past 2 years, also plays a notable role in predicting loan default, with a feature importance score of about 0.017.

Annual Income (annual_inc): The borrower's annual income has a discernible impact on default prediction, as indicated by its feature importance score of approximately 0.016. Lower annual income levels might be associated with higher default rates.

Debt-to-Income Ratio (dti): The debt-to-income ratio is another significant predictor of loan default, with a feature importance score of around 0.015. Higher dti ratios could suggest a higher likelihood of default.

Loan Amount (loan_amnt): While still contributing to the model's predictive power, the loan amount has a relatively lower feature importance score of about 0.015 compared to other factors.

FICO Score (fico_score): FICO score, a measure of creditworthiness, shows a lesser impact on default prediction with a feature importance score of approximately 0.004.

Year of Loan Issuance (issued_year): The year in which the loan was issued also has a minor influence on default prediction, with a feature importance score of about 0.004.

In summary, variables such as interest rate, installment amount, delinquency history, annual income, and debt-to-income ratio are among the most critical factors influencing the likelihood of loan default. These insights can aid in refining lending strategies, risk assessment, and decision-making processes to mitigate default risks effectively.
